# Barotrauma C# modding guide

## Introduction

C# modding is part of the  **[Lua For Barotrauma](https://github.com/evilfactory/LuaCsForBarotrauma)** mod and requires the package `Cs For Barotrauma` to be turned on ([steam workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2795927223)), in some cases the package is not needed and a prompt in game will be shown to enable it automatically.

This modding requires strict source structure, but comes with the benefits of being handled natively by game engine, witch removes many hurdles with type casting or similar issues.
